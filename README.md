Toybox environment for testing object understanding approach. a 3D grid world contains objects which may move around. An agent will be tasked with tracking the location of a given object and scored.

## Project structure

- agent: everything to do with sensing and tracking the objects.
- world: display, object spawning/moving logic.
- scenarios: configurations of gridland to test different aspects of the agents understanding.
- tests: testing for the project.
